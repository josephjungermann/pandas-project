# Tracking Candidate Contributions and Expenditures of 2020 Queens Borough Race

### Write your nutgraf/pitch here:

_Before the pandemic hit the United States and New York hard, New York City was set to hold a special election on March 24 to fill the vacant Queens Borough President spot (formerly held by current Queens D.A. Melinda Katz). The race has since been postponed and there is no set date for when the election will continue._

_Naturally, coverage of the race has gone quiet, but campaign contributions and expenditures are continuing. For this Python exercise, I would like to analyze data that I collected from the [New York City Campaign Finance Board](http://www.nyccfb.info/) on the six candidates who remain in this race. The data I collected parses contribution information by dollar amount, name, occupation, borough location of the donor, the contributor's class (company, non-profit, individual, etc.) and much more._

_The question I want to answer is simply, who are each front-running candidate's biggest contributors and why?_

**Make sure your pitch answers the following questions:**

-   Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?

_A: The Queens Borough race is a special election for 2020. Despite the race being postponed, it will happen once New York City reaches normalcy again. It's best not to sleep on the details now for when the election has a set date._

-   What is the single question your story tries to answer?

_A: Who are each front-running candidate's biggest contributors and why?_

-   Why will this story resonate with your audience?

_A: My beat is urban city government and politics, and I can pitch this to publications like City & State and City Limits, who have an audience looking for this type of content._

**Describe how and where you found the data with links to sources. Put the raw data (csv format) in a folder called `data` in this folder. Make a folder called `notebooks` where you will write your pandas code.**

_Data was collected from [New York City Campaign Finance Board](http://www.nyccfb.info/). For a link to my data and notebooks folder, please view my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/josephjungermann/pandas-project)._

**Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.**

-   _Costa Constantinides, Elizabeth Crowley and Donovan Richards are the three front-runners in this race._
-   _It appears that campaign contributions have stopped coming in as of March 9. Or at least they haven't been update since that date._

**Who are some potential human sources you could reach out to for more info?**

-   _Besides the candidates themselves, I still need to organize and sort through the data to find who the biggest contributors are and what they do. Once I have that info, I can target these individuals, businesses, committees, etc. that have given the most._

**What is the maximum (best) story possible? What's the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn't prove out?**

_A dream scenario would be uncovering campaign finance or expenditure violations. A fallback would just be providing a clear picture of what type of donor each candidate is relying on the most to give them a chance at winning the race._
