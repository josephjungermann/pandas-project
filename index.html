      <h1>Who's Backing Who? Where Queens Borough President Candidates Are Getting Their Campaign Contributions</h1>

      <p>By Joseph Jungermann</p>
      <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States and New York hard, New York City was set to hold a special election on March 24 to fill the vacant Queens Borough President spot formerly held by current Queens D.A. Melinda Katz.</p>
      <p>With no word yet on when the election will be rescheduled, remaining candidates sit on a bed of campaign finance contributions that have helped lift their candidacies to this point.</p>
      <p>But not all candidate's bank accounts were created equally.</p>
      <p>Despite front runners like current City Council members Donovan Richards (D-Queens) and Costa Constantinides (D-Queens) and former City Council member Elizabeth Crowley raising hundreds of thousands of dollars, all three have gotten a boost
        through other contributor types that are not listed as individuals, according to the New York City Campaign Finance Board.</p>
      <p>Below is a financial breakdown for the remaining six candidates.</p>
      <iframe title="2020 Queens Borough President Contributions" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-QJzLg" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QJzLg/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"
        height="548"></iframe>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        ! function() {
          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          })
        }();
      </script>
      <p>Individual contributions do make up more than half of each candidate's total funds received, but other avenues have given the top three earners an edge.</p>
      <p>But perhaps no candidate has received such a clear boost from a specific source than Crowley. According to the financial data, the former Council Member has a clear edge over her competitors when it comes to donations received from labor
        unions, raising $8,450 in collective funds from that group--$7,000 more than her nearest competitor, former Queens Assistant
        District Attorney
        James Quinn.</p>
      <p>Crowley's labor union donations only account for 2% of her total contributions received, but it's the attention of this group that matters the most. Queens has a large working-class population where the median household income sits at just
        under $65K and the civilian labor force is 64.1%, according to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork/POP645218">U.S. Census Bureau.</a></p>
      <iframe title="Labor Union Contributions to Elizabeth Crowley" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-rrQA1" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rrQA1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"
        height="1015"></iframe>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        ! function() {
          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          })
        }();
      </script>
      <p>With a strong list of labor unions representing firefighters, steelworkers, teachers, first responders and the like, Crowley could have some extra support from the city's working class population.</p>
      <p>Considering that this group has been hit the hardest during the coronavirus pandemic, Crowley could experience an influx in voter turnout from middle-class workers who are looking for a favorable candidate and direct line to the mayor's
        office,
        which
        will be dealing with economic shortfalls for years to come.</p>
